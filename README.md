# Decentralized-Gradient-Descent

A simulation of decentralized gradient descent over a set of 1-dimensional parabolic functions, with honest and corrupt nodes communicating in a network.

``Decentralized Gradient Descent.ipynb``: creating data input and making data plots

``DGDSimulation.java``: running the data input and simulating the decentralized gradient descent (it runs much faster in Java than in Python)
